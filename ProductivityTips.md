## Your Personal Life
Your health *must be a priority*. How can you be productive without being healthy? You can't. Health must be your #1 priority.


* Eat less sugar
* Find a sport you like 
* Running, hiking, getting outdoors
* Group training
* 4-5 times a week.
* 1 day per week go tech free. Disconnect from the world, no emails, etc. This is where you recharge!

### Don't do things just for the sake of doing them!
- Gaming, browsing, etc. Aimless and doesn't net any results.
- Look at things you want to do and see if you are wasting your time on then. For example, painting your house or apartment.. you can do it, sure, but you can easily pay someone else to do it.
- Don't do things when everyone else is doing them! Use the late hours of the day to fuel up your car, grocery shop, etc. You have realize that you are saving time which you can utilize much better.

## The Notebook
Start a journal. Write your top 5 quarterly goals, in order. Then write your top 5 yearly goals. Now, read them every day. 

Document what you achieved each day in a short story format. Write down what your top 5 goals are for the next day. Do this EVERY DAY! 

###Keep a "Distractions" list in that same notebook.
Constantly write down what is distracting you or what distracted you throughout the day. Once you have the list and you keep it updated then you can review it every evening. Slowly but surely you will create a habit of setting your daily goals and also identifying your distractions.

## Learn to say "No"
Start saying no to everything that does not add value to you, your focus, and your life in general. **Keep your focus. Protect it**.

Keep a **Stop** ("No, Thanks") List. Write down everything that you are saying "no" to. We have to choose what to give our attention and focus to.
