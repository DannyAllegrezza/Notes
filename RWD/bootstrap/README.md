# Response Web Design using Bootstrap 3

### Bootstrap's Grid Classes
As we now, everything needs to happen inside of a `.container` or `container-fluid`. 
> `container-fluid` will always take up the full width of the view-port.

Next, we need to add a row. 

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
    </div>
</div>
```

* We can have several rows per container.
* The row is where we have our 12 column grid.
